One of the reasons I got into design engineering was [Family](https://family.co/). The first time I used the app I was blown away by the attention to detail and the user experience. I decided to re-create a couple of the components from the app on the web.

## Currency Converter
The number animation in this component uses [Number Flow](https://number-flow.barvian.me/) and shared layout animations from Motion. The text formatting is handled using [react-number-format](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-number-format).

The Use Max / Using Max transition is done by splitting the words into individual spans and animating them using Motion. Thanks to Janum Trivedi for the tip regarding the transition. Adding an `x` translate made a pretty big difference in how the interaction feels.
