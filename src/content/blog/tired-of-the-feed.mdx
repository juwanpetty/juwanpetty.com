# Tired of the Feed

Welcome to the latest version of my personal website. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve rebuilt it over the years—only to tear it down and start fresh weeks later. But this time feels different. I’m keeping things simple, minimal, and intentional.

Why? Because I’m tired.

Tired of social media.
Tired of engagement bait.
Tired of the content slop.
Tired of hearing the ideas of a million people a day, most of which I don’t care about.

At some point, I caught myself scrolling and thought: _Why am I doing this?_

That moment stuck with me. I realized I no longer wanted to give away my time or attention so freely. I no longer wanted my creative output shaped or filtered by engagement metrics. And I definitely didn’t want to spend another year letting algorithms dictate what I see, think, or share.

One of my goals this year is to be more intentional—with my time, my energy, and especially my online presence. This site is my attempt at that. My own little corner of the internet, where I can build something that reflects who I am and what I care about—on my terms.

Over time, there will be tweaks and changes. More of my work. More of my hobbies. More of me.

In the meantime, while I have the MVP of my personal site up, I’ll be focusing on side projects I have in the pipeline that I’m excited to build. As I work through those, I’ll continue improving this site—adding polish, refining the experience, and making things more consistent with a more fleshed-out design system.

This version of the site is just the beginning. It’s minimal by design. But over time, I want it to grow into a space that revolves around my interests, thoughts, projects, and the community I hope to cultivate along the way.

Thanks for stopping by. Here’s to being intentional online and building a better internet.
