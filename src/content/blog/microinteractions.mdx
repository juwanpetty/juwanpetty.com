Microinteractions are the tiny design moments that often go unnoticed—but they’re the difference between a good interface and a great one.

## What Are Microinteractions?

Microinteractions are subtle feedback mechanisms that guide users through tasks:

- A loading spinner while data is fetched
- A button that changes color on hover
- A sound when a message is sent
- A progress bar as a file uploads

They are often invisible unless they’re *missing*—and then users *feel* the absence.

## The Anatomy of a Microinteraction

1. **Trigger** – What initiates the interaction? (e.g., user click)
2. **Rules** – What happens next? (e.g., animation begins)
3. **Feedback** – How does the system respond?
4. **Loops & Modes** – Does it repeat or change based on context?

## Why Microinteractions Matter

- Reinforce system status
- Reduce cognitive load
- Provide delight and polish
- Encourage certain behaviors
