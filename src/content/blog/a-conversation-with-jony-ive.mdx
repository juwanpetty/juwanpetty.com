1. Design is an expression of values

- "What we make stands testament to who we are. And what we make describes our values."
- Products are not just tools; they are reflections of culture, belief, and care. As a founder or
  designer, what you create embodies your principles. Ensure every pixel or feature aligns with
  your core values.

2. Innovation # disruption

- "I have no interest in breaking stuff for the sake of breaking stuff."
- Jony warns against the Silicon Valley obsession with disruption. True innovation isn't
  destruction-it's thoughtful creation that meaningfully moves the human experience forward.
  Create better, not louder.

3. Simplicity is soulful, not sterile

- "You just end up with an uncluttered product-but a kind of desiccated, soulless product."
- Strive for meaningful simplicity-products that are clear and essential, not minimalist for
  minimalism's sake. Simplicity must serve joy and function, not aesthetics alone.

4. Joy matters

- "I think joy and humor has been missing... That weighed on me."
- Jony urges creators to reintroduce joy and humor into products. Delight and human warmth
  aren't frivolous-they are vital to connection and longevity. If your team enjoys making it, users
  will enjoy using it.

5. Care scales through invisible details

- "When they unwrap that cable and they think 'somebody gave a shit about me'—I think that's a
  spiritual thing."
- Seemingly trivial design decisions (like a cable tab) can carry deep emotional resonance. Treat
  the invisible parts of your product with reverence—people feel that care.

6. Measurement bias kills magic

- "We talk about what we can measure, and then assume that's all that matters. That's a lie."
- Teams gravitate toward what's quantifiable-cost, speed, weight-but miss the qualitative
  magic that defines iconic design. Leaders must protect space for the unmeasurable.

7. Culture is built through generosity

- "One person made breakfast every Friday for the team... it makes you vulnerable, and it makes them
  grateful."
- Team rituals like making food or inviting colleagues home aren't soft-they're strategic. They forge
  trust, deepen connection, and infuse the design process with empathy and joy.
